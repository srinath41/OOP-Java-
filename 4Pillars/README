This repository showcases key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java:

- **Abstraction**: Abstract class `Vehicle` with an abstract method `displayInfo()`.
- **Inheritance**: `Car` and `Bike` subclasses extending `Vehicle`.
- **Polymorphism**: Method overloading in the `Calculator` class.
- **Encapsulation**: Private fields with getters and setters in the `Vehicle` class.
