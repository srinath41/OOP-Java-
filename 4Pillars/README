This repository showcases key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java:

- Abstraction: Hides complex implementation details and shows only the essential features of an object.
- Inheritance: Allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
- Polymorphism: Enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class.
- Encapsulation: Bundles data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class.
